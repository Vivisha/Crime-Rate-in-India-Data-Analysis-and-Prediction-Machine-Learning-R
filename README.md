# Crime-Rate-in-India-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-Machine-Learning-R
Using different techniques such as clustering and data analysis, analyzed the dataset and predicted the future crime patterns under different categories.

Analysing-Patterns-of-Crime-in-India
The analysis of Crime patterns in India was performed on a dataset with the demographic information of crimes. This is looking into the aspect of a system that works on clustering which is based on the type of crimes committed and finding out sister cities that would be similar in these aspects.

The dataset contains the datasets used. The following are the files: a. 01_District_wise_crimes_committed_IPC_2001_2012 - The main dataset used for the project b. 2013.csv - Contains the data for the calculation of accuracy of the ARIMA model.
The code contains the following files: a. visualization.R conatins the code for the visualization. b. states_pred.R contains the code for the ARIMA model and prediction for Indian States. c. india_pred.R contains the code for the ARIMA model and prediction for India. d. sister_cities contains the code for the clustering algorithm.
